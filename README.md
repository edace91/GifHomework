# GifHomework
Used the **GIPHY API** to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice. 

## Synopsis

RuPaul Drag Race **GIF** generator webpage calls the **GIPHY API** by using **JavaScript** and **jQuery** to change the **HTML** of the page.


## Project Structure

First part of the the page includes an array of strings. 
The input field takes in the different topic and creates buttons in the **HTML**.
A loop that appends a button for each string in the array.
When the user clicks on a button, the page grabS 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing. Under every gif,its rating  is displayed (PG, G, so on).

## Motivation

Use API, javascript, jquery, to create a fun and interesting page.
